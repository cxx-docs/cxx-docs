It's easy to get lost. Here are some tips how to get help.
Please do your research first, a lot of questions have been asked already.


Getting help
------------

If you're stuck and need real-time help, feel free to join the ``##c++-basic`` and ``##c++-general`` channels on `Freenode`_.
Just ask your questions there and stick around a bit. Please be nice and follow the channel rules.

There's also a `Web Chat`_ in case you don't have an IRC client installed.

.. _Freenode: irc://freenode.net/
.. _Web Chat: https://webchat.freenode.net/


Language references
-------------------

We encourage you to use `cppreference`_ as primary reference.
Watch out for blog posts or introduction videos, most of them are outdated, wrong or simple show-offs.

.. _cppreference: http://cppreference.com


Other resources
---------------

If you're out of luck in the IRC channels, you may want to ask on `Stack Overflow`_.
